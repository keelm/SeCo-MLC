/**
 * The seco package implements generic functionality for simple separate-and-conquer rule learning. <pruningDepth> <pruningDepth> This file
 * implements a generic class for evaluating a rule with the relative cost measure. This is an extension to the linear
 * cost where the covered positive and negative examples are normalized by the total numbers of them. Thus it can be
 * viewed like a parametrized weighted relative accuracy heuristic. <pruningDepth> It is computed by (c*tp/P - (1-c)*fp/N) where 0
 * <= c <= 1. <pruningDepth> The default value of c is 0.342, which has been derived empirically in (Janssen and Fï¿½rnkranz, Machine
 * Learning 2010).
